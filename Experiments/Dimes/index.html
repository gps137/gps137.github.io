Loose change is inefficient. Given a random value between 0 and 99, it takes on average 4.7 coins to most-efficiently represent the value.
<br><br>
So I wrote a simulation for all possible combinations of four coins (to replace the most-common coinage of penny, nickel, dime, and quarter) in order to find the most efficient coin values.
<br><br>
The coding is... inefficient. The time complexity is something like O(10000^n), and this would certainly undergo a far more thorough review if this wasn't simply a passion project.
<br><br>
The coding, which is linked to in the title, finds that the most efficient values of coins would be a penny, nickel, eighteen-cent piece, and either a quarter or a twenty-nine-cent piece. No dimes.
<br><br>
These two combinations (1, 5, 18, 25 and 1, 5, 18, 29) result in an average of 3.89 coins to most-efficiently represent any value between 0 and 99, a marked improvement over the current coinage.
<br><br>
A definite area for improvement might involve performing real-world statistical analysis to determine the most-likely coin values and re-run the analysis with values weighted based on their likelihood.
