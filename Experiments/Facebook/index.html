   <h3>Facebook Phone Search</h3>
   <p>During 2019 in the wake of a scandal caused by their careless distribution of user data, Facebook removed the ability to search for Facebook profiles by phone number.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Humanitarian groups, investigators and reporters, and the Open Source Intelligence community was suddenly without one of the strongest methods of identifying profiles on the most popular social media platform.</p>
   <br>
   <p>While I can't make Facebook reverse its decision, I can undermine it. Using leaked data from 2019, I've compiled a database of over 30-million profiles and their associated U.S. phone numbers, and made them searchable at this address.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Enter a US phone number (with or without a leading 1), hit enter or the search button, and be automatically redirected to the associated profile. Good luck on your investigations!</p>
